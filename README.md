# N1 Health Data Challenge  
#### Completed by Winnie Lau

This repository contains the code and visualizations for the N1 Health Data Challenge. The goal is to identify where a food access program should be implemented, along with the potential impacts of its implementation. The [Food Atlas by the FDA](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/data-access-and-documentation-downloads) was analyzed, and five tiers of need were identified across the country:

- **Tier 1** contains 182 counties and 26.03 million people, requiring urgent intervention.  
- **Tier 2** contains 128 counties and 13.2 million people, focusing on counties with large populations with low access to food.  
- **Tier 3** contains 128 counties and 1.23 million people with high low-access prevalence, focusing on rural communities with low access to food.  
- **Tier 4** contains 330 counties and 7.78 million people, who are moderately in need and should be monitored.  
- **Tier 5** contains the remaining counties.  

With over 40 million people in the first three tiers, a projected program participation rate of 50–85% (on par with SNAP participation in 2022 for different groups, according to the USDA) would mean 20–34 million people assisted. The population groups most impacted by this program are low-income individuals, children, and seniors. One detail to note is that in Tier 3, the proportion of American Indian/Alaska Natives is comparatively higher than in the other tiers.  

The projected impacts of this program include reduced food insecurity, increased economic stability for households, and healthier diets, which can lead to improved health outcomes due to greater food availability.

 - [Plots Folder](https://github.com/wlau818/N1-Health-Data-Challenge/tree/main/Plots): Contains the three main visualizations generated by [Food_Access_Program_Visualization.ipynb](https://github.com/wlau818/N1-Health-Data-Challenge/blob/main/Food_Access_Program_Visualization.ipynb).
   * [county_map_by_tier.png](https://github.com/wlau818/N1-Health-Data-Challenge/blob/main/Plots/county_map_by_tier.png) has each county marked by priority tier.
   * [population_groups_by_tier.png](https://github.com/wlau818/N1-Health-Data-Challenge/blob/main/Plots/population_groups_by_tier.png) is the breakdown of each tier by population groups (low-income, children, seniors, SNAP, household with no vehicles)
   * [race_by_tier.png](https://github.com/wlau818/N1-Health-Data-Challenge/blob/main/Plots/race_by_tier.png) is the distribution of race within each county.
